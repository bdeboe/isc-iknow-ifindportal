# iFind Search Portal

This demo is a basic showcase for iFind features, including dominant concepts, proximity, highlighting and result ranking.
Simply start typing and explore your search results. 
Note that the dominant, similar and related concepts widgets illustrate iKnow's unique concept capabilities, whereas classic search solutions would only be able to display individual words or predefined "good" word combinations.

## Setting up

There is no specific setup required. You can simply point the UI to a table with an iFind Analytic index by adding ?t=Your_Table.Name to the URL, or by subclassing Demo.SearchPortal.Home and overriding the IFP* class parameters.

More details on how to set up and use this app can be found in this article on the InterSystems Developer Community: https://community.intersystems.com/post/iknow-demo-apps-part-5-ifind-search-portal
